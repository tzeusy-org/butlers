# Scripts

Utility scripts for repository maintenance and fixes.

## init-db.sql

PostgreSQL provisioning script to run **before** Alembic migrations on a fresh
database.  Must be executed by a superuser (or the database owner).

**Prerequisites:** The PostgreSQL server must have the `pgvector` binary
installed.  The standard `postgres` Docker image does not include it; use
`pgvector/pgvector:pg16` (or later) instead, or install the extension manually.

What it does:

1. Installs required extensions: `pgcrypto`, `uuid-ossp`, `vector` (pgvector),
   and `pg_trgm`.
2. Grants each butler runtime role (`butler_{schema}_rw` for the 10 butler
   schemas) and `connector_writer` to the connecting user (`POSTGRES_USER`,
   typically `butlers`).

**Why the role grants are required:** The core Alembic migrations create the
runtime roles and ACLs, but they cannot grant role *membership* to the
connecting user on your behalf.  Role membership is required so that
`SET ROLE butler_{schema}_rw` works at runtime for schema-isolated DB
operations.

### Usage

```bash
# Typical dev: run as superuser, grants to 'butlers' (default connecting user)
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d butlers -f scripts/init-db.sql

# Targeting a different connecting user
PGOPTIONS="-c butlers.connecting_user=myappuser" \
    psql -h localhost -U postgres -d butlers -f scripts/init-db.sql
```

The script is idempotent — safe to re-run on an already-provisioned database.

**Note on ordering:**
- Run `init-db.sql` **after** the database and connecting user exist.
- Run Alembic migrations next: `butlers db migrate` (or `docker compose run
  migrations`).
- If you run `init-db.sql` before migrations create the roles, it will log
  notices for missing roles.  Re-run the script after migrations complete.

## dev.sh

Bootstraps the full local Butlers development stack in `tmux` (dashboard, frontend, connectors, backend, OAuth gate, and postgres preflight).

Contacts sync contract: contacts incremental sync is a module-internal poller
inside `uv run butlers up`. `dev.sh` does not launch a standalone contacts
connector process.

### Usage

```bash
# Preferred compatibility entrypoint
./dev.sh

# Direct script path
./scripts/dev.sh
```

## clear-processes.sh

Kills processes currently listening on the expected local dev ports.

Default ports:
- `POSTGRES_PORT` (default `54320`)
- `FRONTEND_PORT` (default `41173`)
- `DASHBOARD_PORT` (default `41200`)

You can override with `EXPECTED_PORTS` (comma/space separated), for example:

```bash
EXPECTED_PORTS="54320,41173,41200" ./scripts/clear-processes.sh
```

## cleanup_logs.sh

Removes old log files and prunes empty directories under `logs/`.

- Deletes files older than 3 days (default retention)
- Removes empty subdirectories after file cleanup

### Usage

```bash
# Use repository logs/ directory (default)
./scripts/cleanup_logs.sh

# Use a custom logs directory
./scripts/cleanup_logs.sh /path/to/logs
```

Optional environment variable:
- `RETENTION_DAYS` (default: `3`)

## fix_beads_dependency_timestamps.py

Detects and fixes dependency records with zero timestamps (`created_at="0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"`) in `.beads/issues.jsonl`.

### Background

Due to a bug in the `bd` CLI when running in no-daemon worktree flows, dependency records created via `bd dep add` may have their `created_at` timestamp set to the zero timestamp instead of a real timestamp. This breaks downstream auditing and timeline reasoning.

### Usage

```bash
# Dry-run mode (shows what would be fixed without making changes)
python scripts/fix_beads_dependency_timestamps.py --dry-run

# Apply fixes
python scripts/fix_beads_dependency_timestamps.py

# Specify custom path
python scripts/fix_beads_dependency_timestamps.py --jsonl-path /path/to/issues.jsonl
```

### How it works

1. Scans all issues in `issues.jsonl`
2. Finds dependency records with `created_at="0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"`
3. Replaces the zero timestamp with the parent issue's `updated_at` timestamp (or current time as fallback)
4. Writes the corrected records back to the file

### Example output

```
Fixing issue butlers-2bq.7:
  - Dependency butlers-2bq.7 -> butlers-886 (type: blocks): 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z -> 2026-02-15T02:15:24.686020053+08:00

Summary: scanned 746 issues, modified 9 issues, fixed 9 dependencies
```
