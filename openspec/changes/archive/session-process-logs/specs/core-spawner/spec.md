## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Spawner Session Lifecycle
After completing a runtime invocation, the spawner SHALL check `runtime.last_process_info` and, if non-null and a session_id and database pool are available, write the process metadata to the `session_process_logs` table via `session_process_log_write()`. This applies to both the success path (after `session_complete` with `success=True`) and the error path (after `session_complete` with `success=False`). The write is best-effort: exceptions are caught and logged at DEBUG level without affecting the session result or propagating to the caller.

#### Scenario: Process log written after successful runtime invocation
- **WHEN** the spawner completes a runtime invocation successfully
- **AND** `runtime.last_process_info` returns a non-null dict
- **THEN** the spawner writes the process info to `session_process_logs` after calling `session_complete`

#### Scenario: Process log written after failed runtime invocation
- **WHEN** the spawner catches an exception from `runtime.invoke()`
- **AND** `runtime.last_process_info` returns a non-null dict
- **THEN** the spawner writes the process info to `session_process_logs` after calling `session_complete`

#### Scenario: No process log write for SDK-based runtime
- **WHEN** the spawner completes a ClaudeCodeAdapter invocation
- **AND** `runtime.last_process_info` returns None
- **THEN** no process log write is attempted

#### Scenario: Process log write failure is non-fatal
- **WHEN** the `session_process_log_write()` call raises any exception
- **THEN** the exception is logged at DEBUG level and the spawner continues normally
